## Overview
### Description
BakedByBrynn is an e-commerce website that was created for a client. She's a local baker who sells cupcakes and other baked goods. This website highlights the delicious cupcakes that she makes. It also gives her an accessible and easy way to sell/display her cupcakes. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Food/ Baked Goods
- **Desktop:** This app is primarily developed for desktop, but it is also available on mobile. It is fully responsive and adaptable to different screens including mobile, Ipad, and Desktop. 
- **Story:** Users can browse through the menu, see the item's details, and order an item. They can also see the details confirmation about the item purchased. 
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app. It can be individuals who are hungry, who have an event coming up, or even just a sweet tooth! BakedByBrynn is for everyone. 
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often as the user wants. It depends on how often they go out for, are hungry, or crave sweets. 
- **Scope:** The first step is to only display cupcakes in the menu. This way, Brynn can start building a specialized customer base and focus on what she does best. After this, we can scale up to including cakepops and other goods. Eventually, the goal is to allow users to leave reviews on the website and rate her baked goods.
